# Mgrant-Portal-SIH
This is our Internal Hackathon SIH Project, where we are developing a digital health portal specifically designed for migrant workers in Kerala. The system will ensure secure, portable, and multilingual access to their medical records, bridging the gap between healthcare providers, government authorities, and migrant communities
